Structure suggestion:

The Core Idea – “Time flow, represented by χ(x), is not a backdrop but a field. When χ curves, clocks slow or speed up; that curvature is gravity.”

Main Characters – a small table describing every symbol:

Symbol	Pronounced	Meaning	Analogy
χ (chi)	“kai”	scalar time-flow field	how fast local time runs
Ψ = ln χ	“psi”	logarithmic potential of time flow	gravitational potential in disguise
g₍μν₎	“gee-mu-nu”	spacetime metric	the fabric of space and time
κ	“kappa”	coupling constant linking matter phase to χ	strength of geometric phase effect
Λχ	“Lambda-chi”	energy scale of χ-field	sets where new effects appear
μ(z)	“mu-of-z”	interpolation between Newtonian and deep time-flow regimes	smooths rotation-curve transition
ψ	“psi (Dirac)”	the matter wave function	standard quantum field
γᵘ	“gamma-mu”	Dirac matrices	relate spinor components to spacetime directions
