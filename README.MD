## 🔭 Abstract
The **Temporal-Flow Field Theory (TFFT)** unifies spacetime curvature, quantum wave behavior, and dark-sector phenomena through a single geometric principle — the **time-flow field** (χ).  
By embedding χ into the affine connection, TFFT extends General Relativity (GR) to allow time itself to curve and interact with matter and geometry.  

- Reproduces **flat galactic rotation curves** without dark matter  
- Explains **cosmic acceleration** (dark energy) as time-flow divergence  
- Bridges **GR and QM** through collapse-wave and frozen-wave dynamics  
- Provides new engineering pathways for **quantum materials and ZPE devices**

## 📘 Key Equations
Modified Einstein field equation:
\[
G_{\mu\nu} + H_{\mu\nu}(v) - D_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}
\]

Time-flow field dynamics:
\[
\nabla_\mu \!\left[\mu\!\left(\frac{\sqrt{\nabla_\nu\chi\nabla^\nu\chi}}{a_0}\right)
\nabla^\mu\chi\right] = \kappa T
\]

Asymptotic galactic velocity:
\[
v_\infty^4 \propto G M a_0
\]
