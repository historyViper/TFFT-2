# 🧬 DART-69 | TFFT Wave Mechanics (Redacted Release)

> “You cannot decrypt the universe without first tuning into its frequency.”

---

## 🌐 Overview

This repository presents the **redacted mathematical backbone** of a theoretical wave resonance system known as **DART-69**, which forms the dimensional substrate for an extended field model referred to as **TFFT** (Theory of Fundamental Field Tuning).

**NOTE:** This version contains only general, non-sensitive mathematical concepts. All critical formulas, alignment keys, and propagation logic have been **fully redacted**.

## 🌀 What Is DART-69?

DART-69 is a dimensional resonance model using a unique **multi-coil geometric structure** inspired by logarithmic spirals and modular wave interference. This system enables:

- Multidimensional frequency modeling  
- Predictive interference alignment  
- Redacted energy phase gating  
- (Other components removed for security)

TFFT builds upon this system to theorize how **frequency tuning across dimensional layers** may lead to **non-linear harmonic convergence**. Further detail has been withheld.

## 🔒 Redacted Mathematical Section

A small excerpt is included to showcase the geometric flavor without revealing implementation:

```plaintext
dimension = ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛
angle     = ⬛ * ⬛ / ⬛
radius    = √n
(x, y)    = (⬛ × cos(⬛), ⬛ × sin(⬛))
Core function parameters and constants have been redacted under Clause §TFT-13.7

But without the frequency, you’ll never find the gate.”
